# Safepay Backend API

A simple Go-based HTTP API for managing invoices and payments, with SQLite migrations and clean code structure.  
Now fully Dockerized for easy deployment ðŸš€

---

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for creating and retrieving invoices, and processing/viewing payments
- Data stored in SQLite using automatic schema migration
- Run locally with Go **or** in Docker using `docker compose`
- Persistent database storage via Docker volumes

## Requirements

### Option 1: Run Locally
- Go **1.24+** installed  
- SQLite3 (CLI or library)

### Option 2: Run with Docker (recommended)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed

---

## Running the API

### ðŸ”¹ Local (without Docker)
```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the server
go run main.go
````

The server will start at:
ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Reset the database:

```bash
rm safepay.db
go run main.go
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Docker (with Compose)

1. Build & run in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

2. View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

3. Stop containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

SQLite database persists in a Docker volume (`safepay_data`).

## Example Usage (with curl)

* **Create an Invoice**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"merchant_id":"abc123","customer_id":"cus789","amount":2500,"currency":"USD","description":"Test invoice"}'
```

* **Fetch an Invoice**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/invoices/<invoice_id>
```

* **Process a Payment**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"invoice_id":"<invoice_id>", "method":"card", "details":{"card_number":"4111 1111 1111 1111", "expiry":"12/25", "cvv":"123"}}'
```

* **Fetch Payment Status**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/payments/<invoice_id>
```

Replace `<invoice_id>` with the real invoice ID returned from the create step.
